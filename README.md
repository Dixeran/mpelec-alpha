Host a mpv player in Electron by using slave mode of libmpv.

Native addon is used to wrap up the original libmpv library.

UI kit: Quasar.
Framework: Vue, Electron

## Why not...

**Why not Qt WebEngine?**

I can't see how to implement a frameless window with a drag area in WebEngine.

**Why not Qt Native or any other thing we use to development native apps?**

I'd like to use Web based UI.
